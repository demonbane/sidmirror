Just untar, copy sidmirror.conf to /etc/sidmirror.conf and edit it, 
and then run sidmirror.pl. You'll need to make sure that you have 
the following available on your path:

find
rsync
rm
pidof
gunzip
echo
savelog

You'll also need the following Perl modules:

Term::Progressbar
Fcntl
ConfigFile

Most of these are probably already there. If you're not running a
Debian system, or if you don't have debianutils installed, you may
not have savelog. Without it, log rotation won't work and you might
get an error on the console towards the end of the run, but
everything else will still work just fine.

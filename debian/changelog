sidmirror (0.11-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Initial setup of Debian package. Still have a few kinks to work out, but
    this will do for now.
  * This version added one major new feature from legacy sidmirror. (legacy?
    well I've been using this for 5 years now, so I guess so. :) ) Users can
    now specify URL's in static-includes, which will be downloaded using wget
    at the end of every run. This was necessary since it's impossible to get a
    working Debian netboot install using only unstable. It's necessary to also
    download one of the daily builds of the installer in order to match kernel
    module versions. As this functionality has not been fully documented yet,
    for the adventurous user, just add a line of the form
    URL,localpath,command where URL is the full URL to an actual file,
    localpath is where the file is to be downloaded TO, relative to LocalPath
    in sidmirror.conf, and command (OPTIONAL) is a command to be run after the
    download completes. It will be executed inside the localpath dir (not to
    be confused with LocalPath).
  * Updated sidmirror.pl and cleanup/dupesearch.pl to use Config::File instead
    of ConfigFile.
  * Changed the user prompt that happens prior to final rsync when not using
    -a to be non-terminating. If the user answers "no" execution will continue
    with the wget download (if appropriate) instead of terminating
    immediately.
  * Added new debian files to SVN.
